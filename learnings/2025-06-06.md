#  Learn in Public – Restaurant Module Work (Kosova Travel Guide)

##  What I Learned Today

Today I worked on the **Restaurant** section of the `Kosova Travel Guide` project. This feature helps users explore top dining spots across Kosovo by city or region. I gathered restaurant data from TripAdvisor and other platforms, normalized it, and created structured entries for each. These entries are designed for frontend compatibility and clean backend storage.

## Key Things I Did

- Built reusable restaurant objects with fields like:
  - `id`, `name`, `location`, `type`
  - `cuisine`, `priceRange`, `rating`
  - `imageUrl`, `description`
  - `tripAdvisorUrl` (optional)

- Converted ratings to a uniform 0–5 scale  
- Used clean camelCase field names for easier API integration  
- Added sample entries for:
  - **Sospiro Restaurant** (Pristina)  
  - **Liburnia Restaurant** (Pristina)  
  - **Buke e Zemer** (Pristina)  
  - **Restaurant Koha** (Mitrovica)  
  - **Restaurant Galla** (Lipjan)

- Wrote concise but appealing descriptions based on reviews and photos  
- Verified locations and cuisines for accuracy using TripAdvisor filters
