#  Learn in Public – Travel Tips Page (Kosova Travel Guide - Next.js)

##  What I Built

I created the **Travel Tips** page for the Kosova Travel Guide project using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucide React Icons**. This page provides essential advice for visitors, including cultural tips, visa info, currency, and basic Albanian phrases.

##  What I Learned

- How to dynamically fetch and display content using `useEffect` and Axios in **Next.js**.
- Rendered icon components dynamically based on category values using a reusable function.
- Implemented fallback error handling for API requests and image loading.
- Used Tailwind's **grid and utility classes** to create responsive card layouts.
- Embedded **tables** to display basic Albanian phrases in a clear format.

##  Key Features

###  Hero Section

- Styled with an overlay + title and subtitle for visual impact.
- Includes a **fallback image** to maintain design consistency.

###  Travel Tips Section

- Tips are fetched from an API (`/public/traveltips`).
- Each tip includes:
  - Title
  - Content paragraph
  - Optional bullet list
  - An icon rendered dynamically (Lucide icons like `Plane`, `CalendarDays`, `DollarSign`).

###  Quick Kosovo Info

- Four columns of cards:
  - Country Info
  - Travel Basics
  - Climate
  - Useful Emergency Numbers
- Each card includes structured rows with key-value pairs.

###  Basic Albanian Phrases

- Two sections: Greetings & Basics, Useful Phrases.
- Each section uses a `<table>` to clearly present phrases with pronunciation guides.
