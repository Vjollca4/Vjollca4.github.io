#  Learn in Public – Contact Us Page (Kosova Travel Guide - Next.js)

##  What I Built Today

I implemented the **Contact Us** page in our Kosova Travel Guide web application using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This page is designed to support user inquiries, show office locations, and provide helpful FAQs — all organized into tabs.

##  What I Learned

- How to manage **tabbed navigation** using React’s `useState` inside a Next.js page.
- Built and styled a **hero section** with a fallback image using the `onError` handler for better UX.
- Created a reusable `ContactForm` component for user messages.
- Applied consistent layout and color theming using **Tailwind CSS** and `var(--enterprise-*)` custom variables.
- Enhanced structure using **responsive grid layouts** for the contact form and office cards.

##  Key Features and Structure

###  Tabs Logic

- Tabs: `Contact`, `Offices`, and `FAQ` handled using a state variable (`activeTab`).
- Styled with conditional Tailwind classes for active/inactive states.
- Icons added via Font Awesome (`fas fa-*`).

###  Contact Tab

- Includes a form (`ContactForm` component) with:
  - Fields: name, email, subject, message.
  - Validation via `required` and input types.
  - Clean UI with padding, shadows, and rounded corners.
- Beside the form, I displayed static **contact information**:
  - Address, email, phone, and working hours.

###  Offices Tab

- Three hard-coded cards for:
  - Pristina Office
  - Prizren Office
  - Mitrovica Office
- Reused phone/email to simplify content.
- Grid-based layout for responsiveness.

###  FAQ Tab

- Used static JSX to display common questions with styled headers and paragraphs.
- Covered:
  - Services offered
  - Booking timeframe
  - Payment methods
  - Languages
  - Accommodations
  - Cancellation policy
- Styled each item as a **card component** using padding, border radius, and shadow.

##  Project File Structure

```bash
/pages/contact.js              # This page (main layout and logic)
/components/ContactForm.jsx   # Form component used inside the Contact tab
/public/...                   # Banner images and icons
```

##  Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – File-based routing and page rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **React Hooks** – `useState` for tab state
- **Font Awesome** – Tab icons
- **Hero image fallback** – Ensures consistent UI even if image fails

##  What’s Working Well

- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout
- Clean tab navigation experience
- Well-organized code and layout
