#  Learn in Public – Tour Module Work (Kosova Travel Guide)

##  What I Learned Today

Today I worked on the **Tour** section of the `Kosova Travel Guide` project. This module helps users explore unique travel experiences across Kosovo. I gathered data for tour packages from tourism websites and tour providers, then structured them into reusable formats suitable for front-end display and backend storage.

##  Key Things I Did

- Designed reusable tour objects with fields like:
  - `id`, `name`, `imageUrl`, `duration`, `groupSize`, `price`, `location`, `description`, `highlights`
- Normalized price per person to euro values (e.g., `price: 75`)
- Created short-form, engaging descriptions based on tour highlights and reviews
- Wrote clean data entries in camelCase for frontend/backend compatibility
- Added sample entries including:
  - **Prizren Cultural Heritage Tour**
  - **Kosovo Highlights Tour**
  - **Brezovica Mountain Adventure Tour**

##  Example Tour Entry Format

```js
{
  id: "prizren-cultural-heritage",
  name: "Prizren Cultural Heritage Tour",
  imageUrl: "https://your-image-host.com/prizren-tour.jpg",
  duration: "2 days",
  groupSize: "Up to 20 people",
  price: 54,
  location: "Prizren",
  description: "Discover the historical charm of Prizren through guided visits to ancient mosques, churches, stone bridges, and the old bazaar.",
  highlights: [
    "Explore the old city center",
    "Visit the Sinan Pasha Mosque and Church of the Holy Saviour",
    "Walk across the iconic stone bridge",
    "Enjoy local food at the traditional bazaar"
  ]
}
```

##  What I Improved Today

-  Built a scalable data structure for dynamic tour listing and filtering
-  Practiced transforming visual web content into structured backend data
-  Wrote engaging, short-form content optimized for tourists
-  Ensured uniform price and group size fields across all entries
