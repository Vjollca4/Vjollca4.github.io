# Building a User Profile Microservice with Node.js
## What I Learned Today
Today I worked on developing a User Profile Microservice using Node.js, Express, and JWT for authentication. This microservice handles user registration, login, and profile management using RESTful APIs with in-memory data storage.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Express Routing: Created modular routes for user and authentication endpoints.

- JWT Authentication: Implemented token generation and middleware to protect profile routes.

- Controller Structure: Separated logic into authController and userController for clean code organization.

- In-memory Data Handling: Used JavaScript objects to simulate a database for managing user data temporarily.

- Middleware Usage: Built authMiddleware to validate JWT tokens for protected routes.

- API Testing with Postman: Tested all endpoints with Postman, including automated saving of token and user ID into environment variables.

```
## Next Steps
- Connect the service to a real database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

- Add input validation with libraries like Joi or express-validator.

- Improve error handling using a centralized error middleware.

- Implement password hashing with bcrypt for secure credential storage.

- Expand to support profile editing and user deletion features.

- Deploy the microservice on a platform like Render or Railway.
