#  Learn in Public — Expense Tracker (React + Node.js + MongoDB)

This week I started refactoring my original Expense Tracker project (which was built with EJS) and migrated the frontend to **React**. The goal was to create a more dynamic user experience while keeping the backend in Express and MongoDB.

---

##  What I Rebuilt with React

- Built the frontend from scratch using **React.js**
- Used **Axios** to send requests to the existing Express backend
- Created pages for:
  - Register
  - Login
  - Dashboard (listing expenses)
  - Add Category
  - Add Expense
- Styled everything with a custom **CSS theme** using warm brown and soft gradient backgrounds
- Used **React Router** for navigation
- Organized everything with a clear structure (pages, components, and styles separated)

##  Folder Structure (Frontend)
```
frontend/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── LoginPage.jsx
│   │   ├── RegisterPage.jsx
│   │   ├── Dashboard.jsx
│   │   ├── AddCategoryPage.jsx
│   │   └── AddExpensePage.jsx
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── App.js
│   └── index.js
├── package.json
```

##  What I Learned

- How to structure a real-world React project
- Managing forms with controlled components (inputs, selects, buttons)
- Communicating with a backend using Axios
- Handling user sessions and errors manually
- Making decisions about form layout and page transitions
- Mapping backend errors to frontend feedback (like showing alerts)

---

##   Backend (Unchanged)

I reused my previous Express + MongoDB backend with small updates:

- Enabled CORS
- Modified routes to support frontend JSON-based requests
- Continued using `express-session` for login
- Mongoose models remained the same
