#  Learn in Public – Terms of Service Page (Kosova Travel Guide - Next.js)

##  What I Built

I created the **Terms of Service** page for the Kosovo Travel Guide using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This static page outlines legal and usage policies for site visitors. It helps build user trust by clearly communicating responsibilities and limitations.

##  What I Learned

- How to create a fully static **legal content page** using semantic HTML elements.
- How to properly set the `<title>` and `<meta description>` using Next.js `Head`.
- Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** for consistent typography and spacing.
- Added user-friendly navigation with a **Back to Home** link at the end.
- Wrote structured legal sections with headers (`h2`) and paragraphs for readability.

##  Key Features

###  Static Legal Content

  - Use of the Site
  - Intellectual Property
  - Disclaimer of Warranties
  - Limitation of Liability
  - Indemnification

  - Contact Information

###  Semantic & Accessible

- Used appropriate heading hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, `p`) for accessibility and SEO.
- Ensured clean layout with Tailwind spacing utilities (`py-16`, `mb-4`, etc.).

###  Contact Info

- Provided a clickable `mailto:` email link.
- Included a visually styled **Back to Home** link using `Link` from Next.js.
