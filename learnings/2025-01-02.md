#  Learn in Public – Privacy Policy Page (Kosova Travel Guide - Next.js)

##  What I Built

I created the **Privacy Policy** page for the Kosovo Travel Guide platform using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This page communicates how we collect, use, and protect user data, enhancing transparency and user trust.

##  What I Learned

- How to structure a fully static privacy document using semantic HTML in React.
- Applied clear sectioning for policies using Tailwind spacing utilities.
- Used `Head` from **Next.js** to set the page title and meta description for SEO.
- Practiced accessibility and semantic writing with correct heading levels and lists.
