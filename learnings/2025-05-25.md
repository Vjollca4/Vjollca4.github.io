#  Learn in Public – Accommodation Module Work (Kosova Travel Guide)

##  What I Learned Today

Today I focused on the **Accommodation** section of the `Kosova Travel Guide` project. This module is designed to help users find and compare hotels across cities and regions of Kosovo. I collected key hotel information from Booking.com and similar platforms, then formatted the entries into structured data suitable for frontend rendering and database integration.

##  Key Things I Did

- Created reusable hotel objects using fields like:
  - `id`, `name`, `location`, `type`
  - `image`, `price`, `rating`
  - `features` (as readable arrays)

- Converted ratings from 10-point scale to a consistent 5-point scale

- Added and structured hotel entries including:
  - **Swiss Diamond Hotel** (Pristina)
  - **Hotel Dardani** (Mitrovica)
  - **Hotel Lybeten** (Ferizaj)
  -  **Metropol Hotel** (Ferizaj)
  -  **Hotel Ador** (North Mitrovica)

- Wrote feature arrays in readable formats aligned with frontend expectations  
- Normalized price values to average nightly rates in euros (€)

##  Example Accommodation Entry Format

```js
{
  id: "hotel-ador-mitrovica",
  name: "Hotel Ador",
  image: "https://cf.bstatic.com/xdata/images/hotel/max1024x768/402101226.jpg?k=8e2452bd8221cb062f6bda0dfb90f1431de8fdc3c93f2143891d194918de1b04&o=&hp=1",

}
##  What I Improved Today

-  **Defined clear data structure** for accommodations to keep things scalable and consistent.
-  **Practiced data normalization** (e.g., price, rating) for easier filtering and sorting later.
- **Ensured UI compatibility** by using string-based arrays and camelCase fields.
- **Learned how to extract structured hotel info** from public listings (Booking.com) in a clean way.
