# 🗺️ Learn in Public – Destination Module Work (Kosova Travel Guide)

## 📅 What I Learned Today

Today I worked on the **Destinations** section of my `Kosova Travel Guide` project. This feature allows users to explore detailed travel information about various locations in Kosovo. I used a structured admin form to input new destinations and wrote both short and long descriptions, selected images, assigned geographic coordinates, and created lists of things to do per destination.

---

## ✅ Key Things I Did

- Entered structured data for destinations using fields like:
  - `name`, `slug`, `region`
  - `latitude` / `longitude`
  - `shortDescription` / `longDescription`
  - `attributes` (tags like city, nature, peaceful)
  - `thingsToDo` in the format `Title:Description`
  - `imageUrls`

- Added and described destinations including:
  - **Leran in Publicë**
  - **Batlava Lake**
  - **Mitrovica**
  - **Prekaz**
  - **Gjeravica & Bjeshkët e Nemuna**

- Wrote short and long descriptions based on visual content from field photos and research  
- Applied proper formatting for structured data to ensure frontend compatibility

## 🧩 Example Destination Entry Format

```js
{
  id: "mitrovica",
  name: "Mitrovica",
  slug: "mitrovica",
  region: "Northern Kosovo",
  image: "https://example.com/mitrovica.jpg",
  shortDescription: "A divided city with rich history and cultural resilience.",
  longDescription: "Mitrovica is a unique city divided by the Ibar River, with strong symbolism and history...",
  latitude: "42.8872",
  longitude: "20.8675",
  attributes: ["city", "historical", "cultural", "divided"],
  thingsToDo: [
    "Cross the Ibar Bridge:See the divide between North and South",
    "Visit the city museum:Learn about the past and future of Mitrovica",
    "Explore the green market:Interact with local daily life"
  ],
  imageUrls: [
    "https://example.com/mitrovica1.jpg"
  ]
}

## 🔧 What I Improved Today

- ✨ Wrote **clean, reusable destination objects** for easier integration with the frontend or backend API.
- 📝 Practiced **content writing** that balances tourist appeal with structured data formatting.
- 🔁 Improved **consistency** across all destination entries (naming, slug formatting, attributes, image URLs).
- 🔄 Aligned **frontend UI needs** with backend-compatible JSON formats (e.g., thingsToDo, image arrays).
